## Reflection

My primary goal of this project was to feature my front-end skills in a full-stack React, Node, Express project.
In order to model a real-life project, I tried to replicate the look and features of Yelp.com. New libraries/modules were discovered while implementing these features:
    -multer.js
    @mui/icons-material
    @mui/material
    deeper understanding of css

This project was a great learning experience, especially client-side. During the developoment of my previous portfolio project, www.thehoopscoop.org (www.github.com/JackPetersenCode/NBA), I was heavily focused on developing the API and learning back-end skills. This project covered many front-end technologies that I have yet to implement on The Hoop Scoop.

I also solidified my understanding of passport.js, and was able to implement a user login/register authentication/authorization system on the front and back end.
